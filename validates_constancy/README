== Validates Constancy plugin for Active Record

http://constancy.rubyforge.org


=== Introduction

This Rails plugin allows you to prevent particular database fields from being
changed after a record is created. A validation error occurs on updates if an
attribute of a model object is different from its value in the database.


=== Installing Validates Constancy

The Validates Constancy plugin is compatible with the latest released version of
the Rails framework (and possibly also other versions -- see
http://constancy.rubyforge.org/svn/plugin/test). You can install the plugin with
the command:

  ruby script/plugin install http://constancy.rubyforge.org/svn/plugin/validates_constancy

Have a look at the Validates Constancy gem
(http://constancy.rubyforge.org/svn/gem) if you’re using a version of Rails
that is not supported by the plugin.


=== Using constancy validation

Here’s how to use this validation in your code.

  class Person < ActiveRecord::Base
    
    # Prevent changes to Person#social_security_number.
    validates_constancy_of :social_security_number
    
  end


==== Options

The validation takes two options, <tt>:if</tt> and <tt>:message</tt>. These may
be familiar because several of ActiveRecord’s validations also use them. The
<tt>:if</tt> option takes a Proc, or a symbol, or string with a model object
argument and a return value of +true+ or +false+.

  class Comment < ActiveRecord::Base
    
    # Prevent changes to Comment#text if it is “locked.”
    validates_constancy_of :text, :if => Proc.new { |comment| comment.locked? }
    
  end

The default error message is “can’t be changed”. Use your own error message by
specifying the <tt>:message</tt> option.

  class LicensePlate < ActiveRecord::Base
    
    # Prevent changes to LicensePlate#number.
    validates_constancy_of :number,
                           :message => 'is off-limits! What are you thinking?'
    
  end

More than one model attribute can be specified. Any specified options will be
applied to all the specified attributes.


==== Warning

With associations, validate the constancy of a foreign key, not the instance
variable itself: <tt>validates_constancy_of :invoice_id</tt> instead of
<tt>validates_constancy_of :invoice</tt>.


=== Running automated tests for Validates Constancy

There’s a suite of tests that exercises all the functionality of the Validates
Constancy plugin. You can check out a version of the test suite from the
repository according to the version of Rails it works with. For Rails v1.2.3,
check out http://constancy.rubyforge.org/svn/plugin/test/rails_1-2-3.
For edge Rails, check out
http://constancy.rubyforge.org/svn/plugin/test/rails_edge.

Then read rails_*/doc/README_FOR_APP to learn how to run the tests.
