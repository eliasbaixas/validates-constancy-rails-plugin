Here are instructions for running integration tests for the Validates Constancy
plugin.

Set up your development environment:

* Download and install Ruby from http://www.ruby-lang.org/
* Download and install MySQL from http://www.mysql.com/
* Install the MySQL gem: type 'gem install mysql' and choose the
  gem appropriate to your operating system
* Create the development and test databases under MySQL. To do this:
  - Type 'rake db:create:all' from the 'rails_2-0-0' directory (the root of this
    Rails application). You may need to 'gem install rake' first
* Create the necessary tables in the development database
  - Type 'rake db:migrate' from the 'rails_2-0-0' directory

Run the tests:

* Type 'rake' from the 'rails_2-0-0' directory
