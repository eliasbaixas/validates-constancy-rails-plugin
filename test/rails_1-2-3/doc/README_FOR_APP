Here are instructions for running integration tests for the Validates Constancy
plugin.

Set up your development environment:

* Download and install Ruby from http://www.ruby-lang.org/
* Install the sqlite3-ruby gem: type ‘gem install sqlite3-ruby’ and choose the
  gem appropriate to your operating system
* Install sqlite3
  - If you’re on Windows, copy ‘sqlite3.def’ and ‘sqlite3.dll’ from the
    ‘integration_test_rails_project\doc\prereq\mswin32’ directory to the ‘bin’
    subdirectory of your Ruby installation
  - For other operating systems, download and install the appropriate binary
    from http://www.sqlite.org/download

Run the tests:

* Run ‘rake’ from the ‘integration_test_rails_project’ directory (you may need
  to ‘gem install rake’ first)
